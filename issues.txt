-------------- ISSUES ------------- june06/2024
---fix: css bug where store images are absolute on the tooltips.
-the store imgs with tooltips, do not even scroll (as in css scrollable-content part)
-tooltips was implemented poorly and html is mixed up in the index.php page @ store section. TOO EMBEDDED.
not separate enough. You could inject the tooltips with js or as a php include() page. perhaps js is less server related
an thus quicker.

-tooltips need variables, so u don't need many pages (for each tooltip, yikes!)

More:
css: get scrollableSection flush with right-side edge of viewport
css: linear-gradient over dash, dash and scrollableSection style the same colors etc., maybe change grey to beighish, match somehow. could look for a png. png would give clean edge with game background behind it. since it's a repeating loop with the stones.
css: 
    1 -- animation to go off with clicks
    2 -- number vari animation to go off also
add:build page profile
add:build page achievements

css:REFACTOR
    1 -- modularize the js (view all, consider, write on paper, write in ide)
    2 -- consider writing more php functions, in mylibrary dir.
    1 -- js score timer every 2 mills, not 1000 like now. 
    1 -- 
    1 --
    1 --

1-get pages connected, ( profile, achievements )

2-delete/replace bad/offensive jokes 

3-?? Possibly move 'Store' header outside the box, so that u can see it more.

4-GET good finishing for dice throw.
Dice: Win/Lose/Neutral

5-THE STORE CODE is reasonably HARD!!
  -item buff / de-buff details,
  -onhover code,
  -has separate db table data, 
  -

6-table: Buildings -> building level, should take an array. so that way you can enter LESS data, and then just loop thru to display right array number.
