### ‚úÖDescription

<a src="https://johnmckirdy.com/">ForgeCraft</a> is a nostalgic, online, idle, clicker game that blends <i>survival</i>, a <i>rich story-line</i>, and <i>resource-hoarding</i>. You are <i><b>Gerald</b></i>, a hapless man whose family has been kidnapped during the <i><b>Great Mutant Uprising</b></i>.

To play the game, create a free account, then a little animation begins, then the game starts.

For each click on the forge, the player receives one <i>forge coin</i>. If you have enough forge coins you can purchase buildings like a <b>water source, shelter, wood pile, fishing hole, campfire, ptarmigan coop,</b> and even a <b>shop</b>. As your survival skills grow, these buildings level-up, and allow you to make forge coins automatically without having to press.

Prices rise exponentially with each upgrade, costing 15% more than the most recently acquired asset of the same kind.

<ul>
    <li>Water Source: Generates 1 forge coin every 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Shelter: Keeps you out of the elements. Each Shelter makes 1 forge coin per second.</li>
    <li>Wood Pile: Stockpiling dry firewood keeps you warm. Each wood pile produces 8 forge coins per second.</li>
    <li>More buildings and upgrades are hidden in the game.</li>
    <li>As your skills increase, your buildings will upgrade from level 1 to 5.</li>
    <li>There are improvements and upgrades available from the <b>store</b>. Some upgrades improve click rates, so you can generate more than 1 forge coin with each click.</li>
    <li>A dice event occurs randomly, and based on the outcome, something happens to Gerald, ranging from very bad, to very good.</li>
    <li>Once every 3 days (in game time), the mutants invade your base, destroying your buildings and progress. You are left with only 1 <i>weird artifact</i>, and a <i><b>burning desire for vengence</b></i>.</li>
</ul>

### üìúStrategy to play ForgeCraft

<ul>
    <li><b>Early in the game:</b> Buying new buildings is always a better investment early, rather than buying more expensive upgrades from the Store. It is recommended to buy Water Sources at the start. Comparing each upgrade item can help you decide how many forge coins you need for a good upgrade. It‚Äôs recommended to get about 25 Water Sources, 15 Shelters, and 15 Wood Piles, and you'll get more efficient!</li>
    <li><b>Mid-game:</b> By now Gerald has the basics for survival, and you can step away from the game and let it run on its own. Try to buy more cheap upgrade items, and always be buying more buildings. You can do something else to occupy your time, then return with many forge coins to buy upgrades.</li>
    <li>The <b>Late-game</b> is often concerned with the incoming mutant invasion of your camp. Level-up your buildings as much as possible, and try to craft a weapon to prepare for them.</li>
</ul>
